What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic HTML elements?
Normal HTML Elements:
Purpose: Normal HTML elements are generic and used primarily for layout and presentation purposes.
Meaning: They do not convey specific meaning about the content they encapsulate.
Examples: <div>, <span>, <p>, <b>, <i>, <table>, <img>, <a>, etc.
Usage: Normal HTML elements are versatile and can be styled using CSS to achieve desired visual effects.
Accessibility: They may not provide meaningful information to assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) about the role or purpose of the content.
Semantic HTML Elements:

Semantic HTML elements:
Purpose: Semantic HTML elements have specific meanings that convey the purpose and structure of the content they wrap.
Meaning: They provide context and clarity to both developers and web browsers about the content they contain.
Examples: <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>, <main>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <time>, etc.
Usage: Semantic HTML elements are designed to represent different sections and components of a web page based on their semantic meaning.
Accessibility: Semantic HTML elements improve accessibility by conveying important information to assistive technologies, making web content more usable for people with disabilities.

Key Differences:
Purpose: Normal HTML elements are primarily used for layout and styling, while semantic HTML elements define the structure and meaning of the content.
Meaning: Semantic HTML elements have specific semantic meaning, conveying the role and purpose of the content for better understanding.
Clarity and Maintainability: Semantic HTML promotes cleaner, more readable code by providing meaningful labels for different sections of a web page.
Accessibility: Semantic HTML enhances accessibility by helping assistive technologies interpret content accurately, improving usability for all users.

In summary, semantic HTML elements play a crucial role in defining the structure, meaning, and accessibility of web content. 
By using semantic elements appropriately, web developers can create more meaningful, usable, and maintainable websites that benefit both users and search engines.


 Disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML
 Closing Tags: 
 Used for elements that encapsulate content or define a block of content within the document structure. 
They require both an opening tag (<tag>) and a closing tag (</tag>).
Self-Closing Tags: 
Used for elements that represent standalone entities or require minimal configuration.
They do not have a separate closing tag; instead, the entire element is defined within a single self-closing tag (<tag />).


What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML?
The distinction between inline elements and block elements in HTML relates to how these elements behave within the document flow, 
their default rendering properties, and how they interact with other elements on the web page. Here's a concise explanation of the differences:

Inline Elements:
Inline elements are HTML elements that do not start on a new line and only occupy as much width as necessary to display their content. They flow within the content of a block-level parent element and do not force a line break before or after themselves. 
Common inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <input>, <label>, <br>, <i>, <code>, etc.

Key Characteristics of Inline Elements:
Inline Flow: Inline elements flow within the content of a block-level parent element without creating a new line.
Width: They occupy only as much width as necessary to display their content.
No Line Breaks: Inline elements do not force a line break before or after themselves.
Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <input>, <br>, <i>, <code>, etc.

Block Elements:
Block elements are HTML elements that start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them within their containing parent element. 
They create a "block" of content that typically stretches across the entire width of its parent container, forcing subsequent elements to start on a new line after them. 
Common block elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>, <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, etc.

Key Characteristics of Block Elements:
Block Flow: Block elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available within their containing parent element.
Full Width: They stretch horizontally to fill the entire width of their parent container by default.
Line Breaks: Block elements cause a line break before and after themselves, creating distinct "blocks" of content.
Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>, <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, etc.
Key Differences Between Inline and Block Elements:

Visual Layout: Inline elements flow within the text content, while block elements create distinct sections or blocks of content.
Width: Inline elements only occupy necessary width, whereas block elements stretch to fill the available width.
Line Breaks: Inline elements do not cause line breaks, while block elements start on a new line and create line breaks before and after.
Default Display: Inline elements have display: inline; by default, while block elements have display: block; by default.
Nested Elements: Block elements can contain both inline and block-level elements, but inline elements cannot contain block-level elements.
Understanding the difference between inline and block elements is crucial for web developers to control the layout, structure, and behavior of HTML content effectively. 
By leveraging the appropriate display properties and structural elements, developers can create well-organized and visually appealing web pages that conform to design requirements and user expectations.
